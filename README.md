my zsh-config
-------------

this repo contains all files I use here for my local zsh.

It is based on the zshrc from grml.org:
http://git.grml.org/f/grml-etc-core/etc/zsh/zshrc

For now, all code is placed in
 `~/projects/zsh-config/`
with a symlink from
 `~/.zshrc`
to 
 `~/projects/zsh-config/zshrc`
